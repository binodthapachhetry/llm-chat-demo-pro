Both values are slightly above the typical fasting range (70-100 mg/dL). If these are non-fasting/post-meal readings, they’re within normal limits.  \n\n**Weight:** Minimal change (181.4 → 181.1 lbs), showing a 0.3 lb decrease. Stable overall.  \n\n**Blood Pressure:** Improved slightly (124/78 → 120/76). Both readings are in the normal range (<120/80 is ideal, <130/80 is still acceptable).  \n\n**Limitations:** Very limited data (only 2 readings for each metric). No data on activity, diet, or other labs. For actionable insights, more data points and context would be needed. Consult your doctor to review these trends in your full clinical context.", "rating": null}
